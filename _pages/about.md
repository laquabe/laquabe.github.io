Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/), and a member of [State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence](https://dm.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes knowledge graph, large language models, and natural language processing. Here is my [research group](https://cogai.bdaa.pro/).

I am advised by [Prof. Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/). Previously, I interned at ByteDance - AI LAB as an algorithm intern. I received my Bachelor degree from USTC in July, 2021, and majored in Computer Science and Technology.
